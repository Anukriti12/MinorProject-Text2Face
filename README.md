## Title
Realistic Face Generation

## Base Paper Implementation
[StackGAN: Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis with Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03242)

## Problem Statement
Although Conventional GANs have shown remarkable success in various tasks, they still face a lot of challenges in generating high quality images since generator and discriminator use the same backpropagation network. So, through this paper, we aim at generating realistic faces using a fully-trained GAN on different datasets.

## Application Areas
- Movie Actors Casting
- Criminal face reconstruction
- Identification of victims for law agencies
- Image editing/Video games
